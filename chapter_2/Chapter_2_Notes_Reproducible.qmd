##Project Management with RStudio

Gotta keep a clean work space to make it easier to find things:

treat raw data as read only

Steps on creating a self-contained project

1.  Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.

2.  Click “New Directory”.

3.  Click “New Project”.

4.  Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. “my_project”.

5.  If available, select the check box for “Create a git repository.”

6.  Click the “Create Project” button.

## Things to practice for project organization

**Treat data as read only**

**Data Cleaning**

*   Most data is "dirty" and needs to be looked over again and reproduced into a format R finds useful
  * This can call for different folders for read-only or cleaned data 


**Treat generated output as disposable**

Tip for good practice

Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing gives the following recommendations for project organization:

1.    Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.

2.    Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.

3.    Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.

4.    Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.

5.    Name all files to reflect their content or function.


Typing >getwd() pulls up the working directory you are on
