## Introduction

Approximately 80% of data analysis time is spent on cleaning and preparing data (Dasu and Johnson, 2003).

Data preparation is not just an initial step but a recurring process as new problems arise or data is collected.

Despite its time-consuming nature, there's been little research on effective data cleaning methods.

Data cleaning involves various activities like outlier checking, date parsing, and missing value imputation.

The paper focuses on data tidying, which involves structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

Tidy data principles offer a standardized approach to organizing data, simplifying initial cleaning.

Tidy datasets and tools streamline data analysis, reducing time spent on logistical challenges.

Tidy data principles draw from relational databases and Codd's relational algebra, framed for statisticians.

While computer scientists contribute tools for data cleaning, they often lack clarity for statisticians.
The development of tidy data is driven by real-world dataset challenges, leading to the creation of packages like reshape and reshape2 (Wickham, 2007).

The paper provides a comprehensive framework for data organization, underlying related packages like plyr (Wickham, 2011) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).

The paper outlines its structure: defining tidy datasets, operations for tidying messy datasets, discussing tidy tools, and concluding with future approaches for data analysis enhancement.
